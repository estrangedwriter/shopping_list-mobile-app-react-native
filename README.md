# BitBroker React Native Challenge
#### Built on Ubuntu Linux version 20 

### Overview 

react native challenge

using react native, create 1 screen that looks like the below:

![screenshot](/images/react-native-challenge.png)  the items should be scrollable. once you are done, create a video demonstration of your code using a tool like 
https://www.loom.com and email the link to hello@dvlabs.uno (if you can reuse any existing email that would be best). 

please also code using github, create a private repo & when done, add the username steven4354 as a collaborator as well.
after you have emailed the video demonstration, a team member will go over the next steps with you regarding the internship application.
best of luck!


### Quick start
#### Installation and configuration to clone and run this application

1. Install and set up the environment. Requires JDK, Android Studio (Android SDK, Android SDK Platform, and Android Virtual Device can be installed through Studio), and Watchman.  https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

  Please let me know if you are having trouble getting the app to run.
  
### Problem Solving

I built two primary components, a Header component, and a ListView structure/component. The Header component contains the "Following" tab, "Followers" tab, menu button, and back arrow button, and the user's name of Parker Miller. I used a ListView structure, so that it would be easier to display all of the information in an organized and structured format. Additionally, ListView components are scrollable.

 - I used a div within the ListItem to store the description, as well as a div container within the div to display figure 1, figure 2, and figure 3 in an organized and neat fashion. 
 - By creating individual containers through which statistical figures can be stored and displayed, the user interface will be able to easily display data.

### Results
I definitely tried to make the app look as similar as possible. I know that the icons in the header are slightly different (the ellipsis in the top right corner, the arrow on the top left corner). I am not sure which library to get those exact icons.
#### Side by side comparison

#### Conclusion 

The images shown in the app are also slightly different, because I do not have the exact same images as the one shown in the sample. Aside from some slight differences, I am happy with the end result but always more room for improvement. I think it looks very similar =). Thanks!
