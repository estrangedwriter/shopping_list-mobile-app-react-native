react native challenge

using react native, create 1 screen that looks like the below:

![screenshot](/images/react-native-challenge.png)

the items should be scrollable

once you are done, create a video demonstration of your code using a tool like https://www.loom.com and email the link to hello@dvlabs.uno (if you can reuse any existing email that would be best). 

please also code using github, create a private repo & when done, add the username steven4354 as a collaborator as well.

after you have emailed the video demonstration, a team member will go over the next steps with you regarding the internship application.

best of luck!
